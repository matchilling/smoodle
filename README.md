# Smoodle

Smoodle (the web applicaiton has been released under the name *Let's meet*, but throughout the codebase 
the initial, tentative name *Smoodle* is still used), 
is a responsive, mobile first single page web app that allows users to create events and share them with
the participants to find out the best date for them. *"Best"* here means the date that works best for the
most people.

Organizers create an event and then share a link with the participants. Each participant can specify which
dates or weekdays do not work for them or which ones they prefer.

The app does not require the creation of any account. The only thing required is the email address of the 
event organizer to send them a secret link used to organize the event.

## Where can I try it out?

The web application is available [here](https://go.lets-meet.app).

## How is this different from Doodle?

While Doodle works well for meetings with relatively few participants, we think that *Let's meet* is better suited 
for events such as parties, dinners, conferences and jaunts with a potential large number of participants. 
In such cases it can be difficult and unnecessary for the organizer to follow the detailed availability of each participant and instead
what is required is a compact overview of how many people can attend or prefer a given date.

## What technology does it use?

Elixir/Phoenix in the backend, Vue.js in the frontend.

## More technical information, installation instructions?

Coming soon :)
